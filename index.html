  <div class="box">This webpage was created by Kate Bartz as a part of her Advanced Computer Science class. This class is taught at Rosemount High School, but Kate also receives college credit through Inver Hills Community College. Everything on this webpage was created from scratch by coding in the languages Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Over the course of the year, Kate will add to this website all of the projects that she completes as a part of the class, and she will continue to edit the website to improve it. </div>
