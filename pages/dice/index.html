        I first created dice using Processing by writing it in java. When I finished it, I transferred the code into Brackets and changed the language into javascript. For my dice project, I used Object Oriented Programming to create many instances of dice. I created a dice class where I coded how the dice look. I then used Math.random() to determine what number (1-6) would appear on the die. Next, I made these dice randomly roll and calculated a total. The goal of the game is to have the dice total reach more than 65 or less than 40. By clicking anywhere on the screen, the dice are rolled again for another chance to win. Everytime the game is played, the number of wins and loses are recorded.
